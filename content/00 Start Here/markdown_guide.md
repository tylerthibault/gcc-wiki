This is a quick reference for formatting your wiki pages. Markdown is just plain text with a few simple symbols that control how things look.

---

## Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headings. More `#` = smaller heading.

```
# Big Heading
## Medium Heading
### Small Heading
```

---

## Bold & Italic

```
**This text is bold**
*This text is italic*
```

**This text is bold**
*This text is italic*

---

## Lists

**Bullet list** (use `-`):
```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

**Numbered list**:
```
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

---

## Links

```
[Text to display](https://example.com)
```

Example: [Grace City Church](https://gracecitychurch.com)

To link to another page in the wiki, use the page name in double brackets:
```
[[Page Name]]
```

---

## Images

First, place your image file in the `content` folder (or a subfolder). Then reference it like this:

```
![Description of image](image-filename.png)
```

Or using the Obsidian-style shorthand:
```
![[image-filename.png]]
```

---

## Blockquotes

Use `>` to highlight a note or quote:

```
> This is an important note.
```

> This is an important note.

---

## Horizontal Line

Use three dashes to add a divider:

```
---
```

---

## Callout Boxes

Callouts are great for tips, warnings, or important info:

```
> [!NOTE]
> Something the reader should be aware of.

> [!TIP]
> A helpful suggestion.

> [!WARNING]
> Something to be careful about.
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use callouts to make key information stand out on a page.

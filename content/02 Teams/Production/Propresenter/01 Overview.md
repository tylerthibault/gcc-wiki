# Overview

## Purpose
This SOP defines the standard process for preparing song lyric presentations in ProPresenter so they are:
- readable (consistent line count and spacing),
- accurate (correct lyrics, spelling, capitalization),
- consistent (theme, formatting),
- easy to run live (groups and arrangements reflect the actual song order).

## Standard Output
A “ready” song presentation should have:
1. Correct lyrics (matching the intended/studio version unless otherwise specified)
2. No unnecessary punctuation or “spoken” ad-libs in the lyric text
3. Roughly **two lines of lyrics per slide**
4. Correct **Groups** (Verse 1, Chorus 1, Bridge 1, etc.)
5. Correct **Arrangement** order for how the song will be performed
6. Correct theme applied (e.g., ANCHORED center-screen, or Upper Thirds when needed)
7. No stray/blank slides (unless intentionally used and grouped as Blank)

## When to use Upper Thirds
Use Upper Thirds when lyrics must be readable over people’s heads (e.g., retreat TV setup).

## Source of Truth for Lyrics
Use a reputable lyric source and be consistent about versions (studio vs live edits).
If the band is known to change structure week-to-week, confirm the intended arrangement.

## Overview

### Purpose
This SOP defines the standard process for preparing song lyric presentations in ProPresenter so they are:
- readable (consistent line count and spacing),
- accurate (correct lyrics, spelling, capitalization),
- consistent (theme, formatting),
- easy to run live (groups and arrangements reflect the actual song order).

### Standard Output (Definition of Done)
A “ready” song presentation should have:
1. Correct lyrics (matching the intended/studio version unless otherwise specified)
2. No unnecessary punctuation or “spoken” ad-libs in the lyric text
3. Roughly **two lines of lyrics per slide**
4. Correct **Groups** (Verse 1, Chorus 1, Bridge 1, etc.)
5. Correct **Arrangement** order for how the song will be performed
6. Correct theme applied (e.g., ANCHORED center-screen, or Upper Thirds when needed)
7. No stray/blank slides (unless intentionally used and grouped as Blank)

### When to use Upper Thirds
Use Upper Thirds when lyrics must be readable over people’s heads (e.g., retreat TV setup).

### Source of Truth for Lyrics
Use a reputable lyric source and be consistent about versions (studio vs live edits).  
If the band is known to change structure week-to-week, confirm the intended arrangement.

## SOP: Create and Manage Playlists

### Goal
Create playlists for practice sets and services so operators can quickly load the correct song order.

### Procedure: Create a new playlist
1. In ProPresenter, find the **Library / Playlist** area.
2. Click the **+** next to the area labeled **Library**.
3. Select **New Playlist**.
4. Name the playlist (example: `Practice Set`).

### Procedure: Add songs to a playlist
1. Select the target playlist.
2. Add presentations (songs) from the library into the playlist (drag/drop or add button depending on your layout).
3. Confirm order matches the set list.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Playlist name is clear and dated if needed (optional).
- [ ] Songs are in correct order.
- [ ] Each song opens and displays correctly in Show mode.

### Training Starter Task
Create a playlist named **Practice Set** and add two songs.

---

## SOP: Create a New Library

### Goal
Create separate libraries for special events (e.g., camps, retreats) to keep content organized.

### Procedure
1. Locate the bar titled **Library**.
2. Click the **+** icon.
3. Select **New Library**.
4. Name the library (use an event-specific name, e.g., `Bible Rodeo Camp 2026`).

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] New library appears in the Library list.
- [ ] You can create a new presentation inside the new library.

### Notes / Best Practices
- Use separate libraries for short-term events to avoid cluttering the main worship library.
- Agree on naming conventions (event name + year).

## SOP: Build a New Song Presentation (Import from Lyrics)

### Goal
Create a brand-new song in the system from online lyrics, then format to the standard.

### Procedure
1. Find lyrics in a web browser (confirm the correct version).
2. In ProPresenter, click the **+** next to Library and select **New Presentation** (or press `Ctrl + N`).
3. Set:
   - **Name**: song title (example: `Glorious Day`)
   - **Theme**: `ANCHORED` (or required default)
   - **Library**: choose correct target library (example: `Hayden’s Practice Library`)
   - **Size**: `1920 x 1080`
4. You should start with 1 blank slide.
5. Go to the **Edit** tab.
6. Duplicate blank slides (`Ctrl + D`) until you have enough placeholders (5–10 is fine to start).
7. Populate slides with chunks:
   - Slide 1: Title (optional, if your org uses it)
   - Next slides: paste Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Bridge, etc. as chunks
   - Do not worry about repeats yet (groups/arrangements handle repeats)
8. Remove punctuation / extra spoken text while you’re here (see [Lyric Editing Standards](#sop-lyric-editing-standards)).
9. Apply **Groups** (Verse/Chorus/Bridge labels).
10. Use **Reflow** to break into ~two lines per slide.
11. Build the correct **Arrangement** order.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Spelling and capitalization are correct.
- [ ] Two-lines-per-slide standard is met.
- [ ] Groups are labeled correctly.
- [ ] Arrangement matches intended performance order.
- [ ] No extra blank slides remain (unless intentionally kept and grouped).

## SOP: Reflow Lyrics (Two Lines Per Slide)

### Goal
Make lyrics readable by ensuring each slide has roughly **two lines** of text.

### Procedure
1. Open the song presentation.
2. Click the **Reflow** tab in the top task bar.
3. Start at the top of the lyrics (typically Verse 1).
4. Place the cursor after **two lines** of lyrics.
5. Click **Insert Slide Break**.
6. Repeat until the entire song is segmented.
7. Confirm slide boundaries match natural phrasing (don’t split a single phrase awkwardly).

### Example (from training doc)
For “God So Loved”, the first break is after: **“Come All You Thirsty”** (per the assignment).

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Most slides show ~2 lines (some exceptions are fine for long/short lines).
- [ ] No slide is visually cluttered.
- [ ] Line breaks don’t create confusing phrasing.

---

## SOP: Create Groups and Arrange a Song

### Definitions
- **Group**: a labeled section (Verse 1, Chorus 1, Bridge 1, etc.)
- **Arrangement**: the ordered sequence of groups used in performance

### Procedure A: Create/Apply Groups
1. In **Show** (or **Reflow**) identify where a new section begins.
2. Select the slide where the section starts.
   - In Reflow: use the down-arrow selector (upper right of lyric section) if needed to select current and below.
3. Open **Groups**.
4. Choose / create the group label:
   - Verse 1, Verse 2...
   - Chorus 1, Chorus 2...
   - Bridge 1, Bridge 2...
   - Tag, Ending, Blank (as needed)
5. Continue down the song until all sections are grouped correctly.

### Procedure B: Create a New Arrangement and Reorder Groups
1. Open the **Group Arrangement** control.
2. Create a new arrangement:
   - Master dropdown → **New Arrangement**
   - Name it (example: `ANCHORED`)
3. Pull groups from the “rail” (source list) into the arrangement bar in the correct order.
4. Confirm repeats are represented correctly (duplicate groups in arrangement when needed).

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Every slide belongs to the correct group.
- [ ] Arrangement order matches the intended/studio structure.
- [ ] Repeated sections are represented correctly (Chorus appears as many times as needed).

## SOP: Create and Apply an “Upper Thirds” Theme

### Goal
Create a theme preset that places lyrics near the top of the screen for visibility over people’s heads.

### Procedure: Create the theme
1. Go to the top-left area and select the **Theme** section (near Search/Text/Theme icons).
2. Create a new theme and name it: **Upper Thirds**
3. When the editor loads, select the text box and type `ANCHORED` (placeholder text for visual reference).
4. Open the **Text** settings panel.
5. Set **Font Size** to ~`90` (adjust if needed).
6. Choose a readable font (rounded/clean; avoid decorative serif fonts).
   - Common option: `Malgun Gothic` (if available)
7. Position the text box near the top (upper third).
   - Use yellow guide lines for alignment.
   - Reference coordinates if needed: **X=240, Y=-270**
8. Return to **Show**.

### Procedure: Apply the theme to a song
1. Open the song presentation.
2. Apply the **Upper Thirds** theme (method depends on your ProPresenter version/workflow).
3. Verify text position and readability.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Text is clearly readable at distance.
- [ ] Text does not overlap important background elements.
- [ ] Position is consistent across slides.

## SOP: Lyric Editing Standards

### Goal
Ensure consistent, readable, and theologically/properly capitalized lyrics.

### Standards

#### 1) Spelling
- Fix misspellings across all slides (use Reflow to scan quickly).

#### 2) Punctuation removal
Remove punctuation that clutters slides, especially if copied from lyric sites:
- commas, excessive apostrophes/quotes (when stylistic),
- parentheses, stage directions,
- “spoken” lines (prayers, shouts, ad-libs) unless explicitly desired.

#### 3) Line formatting
- Aim for **two lines per slide**.
- Avoid awkward mid-phrase breaks.

#### 4) Capitalization rules
- Each displayed line should start with a capital letter.
- Capitalize references to God/Jesus/Holy Spirit, including pronouns:
  - You / Your / Yours / He / His, etc. (per your org’s preference; this doc assumes capitalization is required)

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] No unnecessary punctuation remains.
- [ ] Slide text is consistent and easy to read.
- [ ] Capitalization is correct and consistent.
